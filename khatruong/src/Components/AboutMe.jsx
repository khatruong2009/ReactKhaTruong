      <p>
        I graduated from George Mason University in 2019 with a Bachelor's
        Degree in Finance. I worked in the commercial real estate industry for
        about 9 months before realizing that I wanted to work in the tech
        industry instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, I have been working toward becoming a self-taught Front End
        Web Developer using resources such as: Youtube, Udemy, and FreeCodeCamp.
